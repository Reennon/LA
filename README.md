# Linear Algebra Labs

Welcome to the Linear Algebra Labs repository!

This repository contains completed lab assignments from the Linear Algebra course at UCU, authored by me. The labs cover various topics in linear algebra, including matrix operations, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, vector spaces, and optimization techniques.

## Contents

Each lab is implemented in Python and provides practical demonstrations and exercises to reinforce the concepts learned in the course. Here's a brief overview of the contents:

- **Lab 1**: Introduction to Matrix Operations
- **Lab 2**: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
- **Lab 3**: Vector Spaces
- **Lab 4**: Optimization Techniques

Feel free to explore the repository to delve into the world of linear algebra and its applications in mathematics, data science, and beyond.

## Getting Started

To get started with the labs, simply clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the respective lab directories. Each lab contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks with detailed explanations and exercises.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Reennon/LA.git
cd LA
```

## Requirements

To run the lab scripts and notebooks, you'll need Python installed on your machine, along with the following libraries:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Bokeh
- HVPlot
- SciPy
- and others
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
```
